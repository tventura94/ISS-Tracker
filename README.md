# ISS-Tracker
Track the ISS in real time! Built using ReactJS, MUI, Firebase, and CesiumJS

This is an app I designed and programmed from start to finish, it implements a noSQL database using firebase and CesiumJS to render the 3d components. 
I used standard Material UI components for the sign in and register forms and ReactJS as a framework.

In this video I start by showing the functionality of the login and register, and then go into the functionality of the app itself
