# ISS-Tracker
Track the ISS in real time! Built using ReactJS, MUI, Firebase, and CesiumJS
<h3> How to run on your own server </h3>
<ul><li> Fork or clone the depository from GitHub</li>
    <li> run "npm i" in your VScode (NPM required)</li>
    <li> run the command "npm run dev" in your VScode terminal to start the local server</li>
    <li> Create an account & start tracking the ISS! </li> 
    </ul>
This is an app I designed and programmed from start to finish, it implements a noSQL database using firebase and CesiumJS to render the 3d components. 
I used standard Material UI components for the sign in and register forms and ReactJS as a framework.

In this video I start by showing the functionality of the login and register, and then go into the functionality of the app itself
